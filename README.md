# Hospital-management-System
Hospital Management system includes registration of patients, storing their
details into the system, and also booking their appointments with doctors.
Our software has the facility to give a unique id for every patient and stores the details
of every patient and the staff automatically. User can search availability of a doctor and
the details of a patient using the id. The Hospital Management
System can be entered using a username and password. It is accessible either by an
administrator or receptionist. Only they can add data into the database. The data can be
retrieved easily. The interface is very user-friendly. The data are well protected for
personal use and makes the data processing very fast.
It is having mainly two modules. One is at Administration Level and other one is of user
I.e. of patients and doctors. The Application maintains authentication in order to access
the application. Administrator task includes managing doctors information, patient’s
information. To achieve this aim a database was designed one for the patient and other
for the doctors which the admin can access. The complaints which are given by user will
be referred by authorities.
The Patient modules include checking appointments, prescription. User can also pay
doctor’s Fee online.
